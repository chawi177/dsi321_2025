## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a final assignment for the **DSI321: Big Data Infrastructure** course. It builds an automated data pipeline that collects, processes, and visualizes real-time PM2.5 air quality data in Bangkok using **Prefect**, **Docker**, and **Streamlit**. 

Beyond data ingestion and visualization, the project implements **time series forecasting** with **ARIMA models** to predict PM2.5 levels and help stakeholders anticipate air quality trends.

## ðŸ“Š Motivation

Air pollution, especially PM2.5, remains a critical health issue in Bangkok. This project aims to provide an end-to-end system that not only tracks real-time data but also forecasts future pollution levels to support early warnings and planning.
